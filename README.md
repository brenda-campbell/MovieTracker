## üöÄ GitHub Codespaces Quick Start

GitHub Codespaces provides a complete, configurable dev environment in the cloud. Perfect for quick development or testing without local setup.

### Creating a Codespace

1. **Navigate to the Repository**
   - Go to the [MovieTracker repository](https://github.com/brenda-campbell/MovieTracker)
   - You'll see the repository's main page with files, folders, and a green button

2. **Find the Code Button**
   - Look for the bright green **"< > Code"** button (located near the top-right of the file list)
   - This button is positioned next to other buttons like "Go to file" and "Add file"
   - The button has a download icon and the text "Code"

3. **Access Codespaces Menu**
   - Click the green **"< > Code"** button
   - A dropdown menu will appear with two tabs at the top:
     - **"Local"** tab (shows clone options)
     - **"Codespaces"** tab (what we want)
   - Click on the **"Codespaces"** tab

4. **Create Your Codespace**
   - In the Codespaces tab, you'll see:
     - A text saying "No codespaces"
     - A green button **"Create codespace on main"**
   - Click **"Create codespace on main"**

5. **Wait for Setup**
   - GitHub will create and configure your cloud development environment
   - You'll see a loading screen with setup progress
   - This usually takes 2-3 minutes for the initial setup
   - The environment will automatically open in your browser when ready

### Building and Running in Codespace

Once your Codespace is ready:

1. **Install GitHub Copilot (Recommended)**
   - In the VS Code interface, click the **Extensions** icon in the left sidebar (it looks like four squares)
   - Search for **"GitHub Copilot"**
   - Click **"Install"** on the GitHub Copilot extension
   - You may need to sign in to GitHub and accept the Copilot terms
   - This will provide AI-powered code suggestions while you develop

2. **Install dependencies** (if not auto-installed)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Codespace will automatically forward port 5173
   - Click the **"Open in Browser"** notification or
   - Go to the **"Ports"** tab and click the globe icon next to port 5173

### Production Build in Codespace

To test the production build:

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Preview the build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Access preview**
   - Port 4173 will be forwarded automatically
   - Open the preview URL from the "Ports" tab

### Codespace Tips

- **Port Forwarding**: Automatically handles port forwarding for dev server (5173) and preview (4173)
- **Extensions**: VS Code extensions are pre-configured for optimal development
- **Terminal**: Full terminal access with all project commands available
- **Persistent Storage**: Your changes are saved and persist between Codespace sessions

### Visual Guide for GitHub Newcomers

**Finding the Code Button:**
- On the repository main page, the green "Code" button is prominently displayed
- It's located in the same row as the repository name and description
- The button is positioned between the file list and the "About" section on the right

**Understanding the Codespaces Tab:**
- When you click "Code", you'll see two tabs: "Local" and "Codespaces"
- "Local" is for downloading/cloning to your computer
- "Codespaces" is for creating a cloud development environment
- If you don't see the Codespaces tab, make sure you're signed into GitHub

**VS Code Interface in Codespace:**
